# git-clone

This is a super simple script for organizing github repos on your local filesystem. It accepts one argument, a URL to a GitHub repo, and will clone it to

```
~/github/<username>/<reponame>
```

So this repo would be cloned to:

```
~/github/jacobsmith/git-clone
```

I am not the creator of this naming scheme - I forget where I initially read about it, but keeping everything relative to the github format seems like a much better orgnanization stystem than I had before (everything in a single `Code` directory).
